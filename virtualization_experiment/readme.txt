class_defs.py was integrated into virtualization_experiment.ipynb by using a Linux 
symlink. This prevents needing to make a copy of class_defs.py but may prevent 
this program from running on Windows. If one is running this program on Windows, 
copy class_defs.py from the 'master_script' folder to the 'virtualization_experiment' 
folder.
